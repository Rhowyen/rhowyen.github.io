# Rhowyen - Clown Queen Streamer

A cozy, forest-inspired personal homepage for my streaming presence.  
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted via GitHub Pages.

The site acts as a central hub for:
- My stream links
- About me info
- Streaming schedule
- Community Discord
- Enchanted forest vibes 

Inspired by early MySpace layouts, woodland aesthetics, and cozy internet spaces.
